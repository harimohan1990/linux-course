Sure! Here’s a concise overview of each topic related to Linux:

### 1. What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it popular for servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Linux is built around the Linux kernel, which manages hardware resources and provides a platform for applications to run.

### 2. History of Linux
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a personal project to develop a free and open-source alternative to the MINIX operating system. The first version, Linux 0.01, was released in September 1991. Over the years, Linux has evolved significantly, supported by a vast community of developers and organizations. It has become the foundation for many operating systems and is widely used in servers, desktops, and mobile devices.

### 3. Linux Distributions Overview
Linux distributions (distros) are variations of Linux that include the Linux kernel, system libraries, and applications. Some popular distributions include:

- **Ubuntu**: User-friendly and widely used, ideal for beginners and desktop users.
- **Fedora**: Known for its cutting-edge features and technologies, often used by developers.
- **CentOS**: A community-supported distribution derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), popular for servers.
- **Debian**: Known for its stability and extensive package management system.
- **Arch Linux**: A rolling release distribution aimed at advanced users who want to customize their system.

### 4. Installing Linux
Linux can be installed in several ways:

- **Dual Boot**: This involves partitioning your hard drive to install Linux alongside another operating system (like Windows). During boot, you can choose which OS to run.
- **Virtual Machines**: Using software like VirtualBox or VMware, you can install Linux on a virtual machine, allowing you to run Linux alongside your primary OS without modifying your hard drive.


Here’s a brief overview of basic Linux commands categorized by their functionalities:

### 1. Navigating the File System
- **`ls`**: Lists files and directories in the current directory. You can use options like `-l` for detailed information or `-a` to show hidden files.
- **`cd`**: Changes the current directory. For example, `cd Documents` moves you to the Documents directory. Use `cd ..` to go up one level.
- **`pwd`**: Prints the current working directory, showing the full path of your current location in the file system.

### 2. File Operations
- **`cp`**: Copies files or directories. For example, `cp file.txt /path/to/destination/` copies `file.txt` to the specified destination.
- **`mv`**: Moves or renames files or directories. For example, `mv oldname.txt newname.txt` renames a file, while `mv file.txt /path/to/destination/` moves it.
- **`rm`**: Removes files or directories. Use with caution, as `rm file.txt` deletes the file permanently. For directories, use `rm -r directory_name`.
- **`touch`**: Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file. For example, `touch newfile.txt` creates a new file named `newfile.txt`.
- **`mkdir`**: Creates a new directory. For example, `mkdir new_directory` creates a directory named `new_directory`.

### 3. Viewing Files
- **`cat`**: Concatenates and displays the contents of a file. For example, `cat file.txt` shows the contents of `file.txt`.
- **`less`**: Allows you to view the contents of a file one screen at a time, with the ability to scroll. Use `less file.txt`.
- **`more`**: Similar to `less`, but with more limited navigation options. Use `more file.txt` to view a file.
- **`head`**: Displays the first few lines of a file. For example, `head -n 10 file.txt` shows the first 10 lines.
- **`tail`**: Displays the last few lines of a file. For example, `tail -n 10 file.txt` shows the last 10 lines.

### 4. Understanding File Permissions and Ownership
- **`chmod`**: Changes the file permissions. For example, `chmod 755 file.txt` sets the permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.
- **`chown`**: Changes the ownership of a file or directory. For example, `chown user:group file.txt` changes the owner to `user` and the group to `group`.


Here’s an overview of some essential text processing tools in Linux, along with information on redirecting output and input, and piping commands:

### 1. Using `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`
- **`grep`**: A powerful search utility that searches for specific patterns within files. For example, `grep "search_term" filename.txt` finds all occurrences of "search_term" in `filename.txt`. You can use options like `-i` for case-insensitive search and `-r` for recursive search in directories.

- **`sed`**: A stream editor used for modifying text in a file or input stream. Commonly used for substitution, for example: `sed 's/old/new/g' filename.txt` replaces all occurrences of "old" with "new" in `filename.txt`. You can also use `sed` to delete lines or insert new text.

- **`awk`**: A powerful programming language designed for text processing and data extraction. It works well with structured data, such as CSV files. For example, `awk '{print $1}' filename.txt` prints the first column of each line in `filename.txt`. You can use conditions and functions to perform more complex operations.

### 2. Redirecting Output and Input
- **Redirecting Output**: You can redirect the output of a command to a file using the `>` operator. For example, `ls > file_list.txt` saves the output of the `ls` command to `file_list.txt`. To append to a file, use `>>`, like so: `echo "New entry" >> file_list.txt`.

- **Redirecting Input**: You can also redirect input from a file using the `<` operator. For example, `sort < unsorted.txt` sorts the contents of `unsorted.txt`.

### 3. Piping Commands
Piping allows you to use the output of one command as the input to another command, enabling powerful command combinations. The pipe operator `|` is used for this purpose. For example:
- `cat file.txt | grep "search_term"`: This command first displays the contents of `file.txt` and then filters the output to show only lines containing "search_term".
- `ps aux | awk '{print $1}'`: This command lists all running processes and uses `awk` to print the user names of those processes.


Here’s an overview of file system management in Linux, covering the file system hierarchy, mounting and unmounting file systems, and disk usage management:

### 1. Understanding the Linux File System Hierarchy
The Linux file system hierarchy is organized in a tree-like structure, with the root directory (`/`) at the top. Key directories include:

- **`/bin`**: Contains essential command binaries (executables) needed for system boot and repair.
- **`/boot`**: Contains files needed to boot the system, including the Linux kernel.
- **`/etc`**: Contains configuration files for the system and installed applications.
- **`/home`**: User home directories are stored here. Each user has a subdirectory (e.g., `/home/username`).
- **`/lib`**: Contains shared libraries needed by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- **`/media`**: Mount points for removable media like USB drives and CDs.
- **`/mnt`**: A generic mount point for temporarily mounting file systems.
- **`/opt`**: Contains optional software packages.
- **`/tmp`**: Temporary files created by applications.
- **`/usr`**: Contains user utilities and applications, including `/usr/bin` for user commands and `/usr/lib` for libraries.
- **`/var`**: Contains variable data files, such as logs and databases.

### 2. Mounting and Unmounting File Systems
Mounting is the process of making a file system accessible at a certain point in the directory tree. 

- **Mounting**: To mount a file system, use the `mount` command. For example:
  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive
  ```
  This command mounts the device `/dev/sdb1` to the directory `/mnt/mydrive`. You can specify file system types with the `-t` option if necessary.

- **Unmounting**: To unmount a file system, use the `umount` command:
  ```bash
  sudo umount /mnt/mydrive
  ```
  This command unmounts the file system mounted at `/mnt/mydrive`.

### 3. Disk Usage and Management
- **`df`**: Displays information about disk space usage for mounted file systems. For example:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
  The `-h` option shows sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).

- **`du`**: Displays disk usage of files and directories. For example:
  ```bash
  du -sh /path/to/directory
  ```
  The `-s` option provides a summary of the total size, and `-h` makes it human-readable. You can use `du -h` to see the sizes of all files and subdirectories within a directory.

Here’s an overview of user management in Linux, covering user and group management, understanding user permissions, and switching users:

### 1. Creating and Managing Users and Groups
- **Creating Users**: You can create a new user with the `useradd` command. For example:
  ```bash
  sudo useradd username
  ```
  To set a password for the new user, use:
  ```bash
  sudo passwd username
  ```

- **Managing Users**: You can modify user attributes using the `usermod` command. For example, to add a user to a group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG groupname username
  ```

- **Creating Groups**: Use the `groupadd` command to create a new group:
  ```bash
  sudo groupadd groupname
  ```

- **Managing Groups**: You can modify group attributes using the `groupmod` command or remove a group with `groupdel`:
  ```bash
  sudo groupdel groupname
  ```

### 2. Understanding User Permissions
User permissions in Linux control access to files and directories. Each file or directory has three types of permissions:

- **Read (`r`)**: Allows reading the file or listing the directory.
- **Write (`w`)**: Allows modifying the file or adding/removing files in the directory.
- **Execute (`x`)**: Allows executing a file or accessing a directory.

Permissions are assigned to three categories of users:

- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: Users who are members of the file’s group.
- **Others**: All other users.

You can view permissions using the `ls -l` command, which displays a detailed list of files and their permissions. To change permissions, use `chmod`:
```bash
chmod 755 filename
```
This command sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, and read and execute permissions for the group and others.

### 3. Switching Users (`su`, `sudo`)
- **`su` (Switch User)**: This command allows you to switch to another user account. For example, to switch to the root user:
  ```bash
  su -
  ```
  You’ll need to enter the password for the target user.

- **`sudo` (Super User Do)**: This command allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the `sudoers` configuration. For example:
  ```bash
  sudo command
  ```
Here’s an overview of basic shell scripting in Linux, covering the introduction to shell scripting, writing and executing simple scripts, and using variables and control structures:

### 1. Introduction to Shell Scripting
Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks in Unix/Linux systems by writing scripts that contain a series of commands. A shell script is a plain text file that includes commands for the shell to execute. The most common shell for scripting is Bash (Bourne Again SHell).

### 2. Writing and Executing Simple Scripts
To create a shell script:

1. **Create a new file**: Use a text editor like `nano` or `vim`. For example:
   ```bash
   nano myscript.sh
   ```

2. **Add a shebang**: The first line should specify the interpreter. For Bash scripts, use:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

3. **Write your commands**: Below the shebang, add the commands you want to execute. For example:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

4. **Save and exit**: If using `nano`, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter` to save.

5. **Make the script executable**: Change the file permissions to make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x myscript.sh
   ```

6. **Execute the script**: Run the script using:
   ```bash
   ./myscript.sh
   ```

### 3. Variables and Control Structures
- **Variables**: You can store values in variables. For example:
  ```bash
  name="Alice"
  echo "Hello, $name!"
  ```
  Note that there should be no spaces around the `=` sign.

- **Control Structures**:
  - **If-Else Statements**: Used for conditional execution.
    ```bash
    if [ "$name" == "Alice" ]; then
        echo "Welcome, Alice!"
    else
        echo "Who are you?"
    fi
    ```

  - **Loops**: You can use `for` and `while` loops to repeat commands.
    - **For Loop**:
      ```bash
      for i in {1..5}; do
          echo "Iteration $i"
      done
      ```

    - **While Loop**:
      ```bash
      count=1
      while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
          echo "Count is $count"
          ((count++))
      done
      ```
Here’s an overview of advanced shell scripting concepts, including functions, error handling and debugging, and using command-line arguments:

### 1. Functions in Shell Scripts
Functions allow you to group commands into reusable blocks. They help organize your script and avoid repetition. Here’s how to define and use functions:

- **Defining a Function**:
  ```bash
  my_function() {
      echo "This is my function!"
  }
  ```

- **Calling a Function**:
  ```bash
  my_function
  ```

- **Functions with Arguments**: You can pass arguments to functions:
  ```bash
  greet() {
      echo "Hello, $1!"
  }
  
  greet "Alice"  # Output: Hello, Alice!
  ```

### 2. Error Handling and Debugging Scripts
Error handling is crucial for creating robust scripts. You can use various techniques to handle errors and debug scripts:

- **Exit Status**: Every command returns an exit status. A status of `0` indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates an error. You can check the exit status using `$?`:
  ```bash
  command
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Command failed!"
  fi
  ```

- **Using `set -e`**: This option causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails:
  ```bash
  set -e
  ```

- **Debugging with `set -x`**: This option enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal:
  ```bash
  set -x
  ```

- **Error Handling with `trap`**: You can use `trap` to catch errors and clean up:
  ```bash
  trap 'echo "An error occurred. Exiting..."; exit 1;' ERR
  ```

### 3. Using Command-Line Arguments
You can pass arguments to your script when executing it. These arguments are accessed using special variables:

- **Accessing Arguments**:
  - `$0`: The name of the script.
  - `$1`, `$2`, etc.: The first, second, etc., arguments passed to the script.
  - `$#`: The number of arguments.
  - `$@`: All arguments as a list.
  - `$*`: All arguments as a single word.

- **Example of Using Command-Line Arguments**:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Script name: $0"
  echo "First argument: $1"
  echo "Total arguments: $#"
  
  for arg in "$@"; do
      echo "Argument: $arg"
  done
  ```

You can run this script with:
```bash
./myscript.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
```

Here’s an overview of package management in Linux, focusing on installing and managing software packages using various package managers, as well as understanding repositories and package sources:

### 1. Installing and Managing Software Packages
Different Linux distributions use different package management systems. Here are the three most common ones:

- **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**: Used primarily in Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu.
  - **Installing a Package**: 
    ```bash
    sudo apt update            # Update the package list
    sudo apt install package_name  # Install a package
    ```
  - **Removing a Package**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt remove package_name  # Remove a package
    ```
  - **Upgrading Packages**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt upgrade            # Upgrade all installed packages
    ```

- **YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified)**: Used in Red Hat-based distributions like CentOS and Fedora.
  - **Installing a Package**:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install package_name  # Install a package
    ```
  - **Removing a Package**:
    ```bash
    sudo yum remove package_name   # Remove a package
    ```
  - **Upgrading Packages**:
    ```bash
    sudo yum update                # Upgrade all installed packages
    ```

- **RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)**: A low-level package manager for Red Hat-based distributions.
  - **Installing a Package**:
    ```bash
    sudo rpm -ivh package.rpm  # Install a package
    ```
  - **Removing a Package**:
    ```bash
    sudo rpm -e package_name    # Remove a package
    ```
  - **Querying Packages**:
    ```bash
    rpm -qa                     # List all installed packages
    ```

### 2. Understanding Repositories and Package Sources
Repositories are storage locations from which software packages can be retrieved and installed on your system. They are essential for package management, as they provide a centralized location for software distribution.

- **Types of Repositories**:
  - **Official Repositories**: Maintained by the distribution maintainers and provide stable software that is tested and verified.
  - **Third-party Repositories**: Provided by external developers or organizations and may offer additional or updated software not found in official repositories.

- **Adding Repositories**:
  - For **APT**:
    You can add a repository by editing the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file or by using the `add-apt-repository` command:
    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:repository_name
    sudo apt update
    ```

  - For **YUM**:
    You can add a repository by creating a `.repo` file in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory:
    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/newrepo.repo
    ```

- **Package Sources**: 
  - The package manager retrieves packages from these repositories. Each repository has a URL that points to its location. The package manager checks these URLs for updates and new packages based on the configuration in its settings.
 
  Here’s an overview of networking basics in Linux, covering the TCP/IP and OSI models, basic networking commands, and configuring network interfaces:

### 1. Understanding TCP/IP and OSI Model
- **TCP/IP Model**: The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is a set of communication protocols used for the Internet and similar networks. It has four layers:
  - **Application Layer**: Deals with application-level protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
  - **Transport Layer**: Manages end-to-end communication (e.g., TCP, UDP).
  - **Internet Layer**: Handles routing and addressing (e.g., IP).
  - **Link Layer**: Controls the physical network hardware (e.g., Ethernet).

- **OSI Model**: The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers:
  1. **Application Layer**: End-user services (HTTP, FTP).
  2. **Presentation Layer**: Data format translation and encryption.
  3. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions between applications.
  4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP, UDP).
  5. **Network Layer**: Handles routing and forwarding (IP).
  6. **Data Link Layer**: Facilitates node-to-node data transfer (Ethernet).
  7. **Physical Layer**: Transmits raw bitstreams over physical media.

### 2. Basic Networking Commands
- **`ping`**: Tests connectivity to another host by sending ICMP echo requests. For example:
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```

- **`ifconfig`**: Displays or configures network interfaces. It shows the current network configuration, including IP addresses. (Note: `ifconfig` is being replaced by `ip` command in newer distributions.)
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```

- **`netstat`**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics. For example:
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln  # Shows listening ports and associated programs
  ```

- **`traceroute`**: Traces the route packets take to reach a network host. It helps identify where delays occur. For example:
  ```bash
  traceroute google.com
  ```

### 3. Configuring Network Interfaces
Network interfaces can be configured using various methods, depending on whether you are using a graphical interface or command line.

- **Using `ifconfig`** (deprecated in favor of `ip`):
  - To assign an IP address:
    ```bash
    sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    ```

- **Using `ip` command**:
  - To assign an IP address:
    ```bash
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
    ```
  - To bring an interface up or down:
    ```bash
    sudo ip link set eth0 up
    sudo ip link set eth0 down
    ```

- **Editing Configuration Files**: Network configurations are often stored in files. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can edit `/etc/network/interfaces`, and on Red Hat-based systems, you can edit files in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`.

Here’s an overview of process management and system monitoring in Linux, covering understanding processes, managing processes, using `cron` for scheduling tasks, and monitoring system performance:

### 10. Process Management
#### Understanding Processes and Jobs
- **Processes**: A process is an instance of a running program. Each process has a unique Process ID (PID) and is managed by the operating system.
- **Jobs**: Jobs are processes that are started from a shell. They can run in the foreground (interacting with the user) or in the background (running without user interaction).

#### Managing Processes
- **`ps`**: Displays information about running processes. Common usage:
  ```bash
  ps aux           # Shows all running processes with detailed information
  ```

- **`top`**: Provides a dynamic, real-time view of system processes, showing CPU and memory usage. You can use `top` to monitor resource usage and manage processes interactively.

- **`kill`**: Sends a signal to a process, typically to terminate it. For example:
  ```bash
  kill PID         # Replace PID with the actual process ID
  ```
  You can use `kill -9 PID` for a forceful termination.

- **`bg`**: Resumes a suspended job in the background. For example:
  ```bash
  bg %1            # Resumes job number 1 in the background
  ```

- **`fg`**: Brings a background job to the foreground. For example:
  ```bash
  fg %1            # Brings job number 1 to the foreground
  ```

#### Using `cron` for Scheduling Tasks
- **`cron`**: A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It allows you to run scripts or commands at specified intervals.
- **Editing the Crontab**: Use the `crontab -e` command to edit the cron jobs for your user. The syntax for a cron job is:
  ```
  * * * * * command_to_run
  ```
  The five asterisks represent minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week, respectively. For example, to run a script every day at 2 AM:
  ```
  0 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh
  ```

### 11. System Monitoring and Performance Tuning
#### Monitoring System Performance
- **`top`**: As mentioned earlier, it provides real-time monitoring of system processes and resource usage.

- **`htop`**: An enhanced version of `top` with a more user-friendly interface, allowing for easier process management and sorting.

- **`vmstat`**: Reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity. For example:
  ```bash
  vmstat 1          # Updates every second
  ```

- **`iostat`**: Monitors system input/output device loading by observing the time devices are active in relation to their average transfer rates. For example:
  ```bash
  iostat -x 1      # Provides extended statistics every second
  ```

#### Understanding Logs and Log Management
- **`syslog`**: A standard for message logging in Unix-like systems. It collects and stores log messages from various system components and applications.

- **`journalctl`**: A command-line tool to query and display messages from the journal, which is managed by `systemd`. It allows you to review logs with various filtering options. For example:
  ```bash
  journalctl -u service_name    # View logs for a specific service
  journalctl --since "2025-05-01"  # View logs since a specific date
  ```
Here’s an overview of **Virtualization and Containers** and **System Administration**, covering virtualization technologies, Docker, Kubernetes, managing system services, backup and recovery strategies, and system updates:

---

### **14. Virtualization and Containers**

#### Introduction to Virtualization
- **Virtualization** allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine by creating virtual instances. This is useful for testing, development, and resource optimization.

- **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)**: A Linux kernel module that enables the kernel to function as a hypervisor. It is built into the Linux kernel and allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) with their own operating systems.
  - To install KVM on a Debian-based system:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils
    ```
  - To manage VMs, you can use tools like `virt-manager` for a graphical interface or `virsh` for command-line management.

- **VirtualBox**: A cross-platform virtualization software that allows you to create and manage VMs easily. It provides a user-friendly GUI.
  - To install VirtualBox:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install virtualbox
    ```
  - You can create and manage VMs through the VirtualBox GUI or command-line interface.

#### Working with Docker and Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- **Docker**: A platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.
  - To install Docker:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install docker.io
    ```
  - To run a simple Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```
  - To manage Docker images and containers, use commands like `docker ps`, `docker images`, and `docker rm`.

- **Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps manage clusters of Docker containers.

### **15. System Administration**

#### Managing System Services
- **systemd**: A system and service manager for Linux that initializes the system and manages services. It uses units to define services, sockets, and other resources.
  - To start, stop, or restart a service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start service_name
    sudo systemctl stop service_name
    sudo systemctl restart service_name
    ```
  - To enable or disable a service at boot:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable service_name
    sudo systemctl disable service_name
    ```

- **init.d**: A traditional method for managing services in Unix-like systems. It uses scripts located in `/etc/init.d/`.
  - To start or stop a service:
    ```bash
    sudo /etc/init.d/service_name start
    sudo /etc/init.d/service_name stop
    ```

#### Backup and Recovery Strategies
- **Backup Tools**: Use tools like `rsync`, `tar`, or dedicated backup software (e.g., `Bacula`, `Duplicity`) to create backups.
  - Example using `rsync`:
    ```bash
    rsync -av --delete /source/directory /backup/directory
    ```

- **Automated Backups**: Schedule backups using `cron` jobs to ensure regular backups.
  
- **Testing Recovery**: Regularly test your backup and recovery process to ensure data integrity and accessibility.

#### System Updates and Patch Management
- **Updating Packages**: Regularly update your system to ensure security and stability.
  - For APT-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```
  - For YUM-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo yum update
    ```

- **Patch Management**: Implement a patch management strategy to ensure all software is up-to-date. This may involve:
  - Monitoring for updates from vendors.
  - Testing patches in a staging environment before deploying them to production.

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 myapp:latest
    ```

- **Orchestration with Kubernetes**: Manage containerized applications across clusters.
  - **Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster**: Use Minikube for local development or GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) for production.
  - **Deploying an Application**:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: myapp
    spec:
      replicas: 3
